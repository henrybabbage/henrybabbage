I’m Henry, a Fullstack Engineer from Aotearoa / New Zealand, now based between Paris and Berlin.

I have a background in design and fine art, and I combine this expertise in all of my work with an attentiveness for good patterns and architecture, placing importance on design execution, accessibility standards, performance and maintainability. I'm passionate about collaborating with designers, engineers and teams to build polished experiences for software and the web.
