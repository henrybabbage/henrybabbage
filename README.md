I’m Henry, a Fullstack Engineer from Aotearoa / New Zealand, now based between Paris and Berlin.

I have a background in design and fine art, and I combine this expertise with an attentiveness for good patterns and architecture, especially placing importance on design execution, accessibility standards, performance and maintainability. I collaborate with designers and engineers to build polished software and web experiences.
